Docker: Package each service
Docker Compose: Run all services locally
Kubernetes (Optional): For production deployment

AWS Services (Basic)

EC2: Host services (or use ECS)
RDS: Managed PostgreSQL
S3: Store parking lot images
SES: Send emails

📊 How Services Communicate
Synchronous (REST APIs)
User → API Gateway → Parking Lot Service (search spots)
User → API Gateway → Booking Service (create booking)
Asynchronous (Kafka)
Booking Service → Kafka → Notification Service (send confirmation)
Payment Service → Kafka → Booking Service (update booking status)
